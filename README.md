# Lab 1

A simple .NET Core console application delivering a quiz about .NET Core.


## Usage

Upon executing the program, the user will be asked if they want to begin the quiz.  If they click yes, they will take a ten question quiz.  At the end they will get a score and will see what questions they got wrong.  They then have the option to take the quiz again.  If they don't select that option, the program closes.

## Technologies
This project uses various methods and properties from the console class, including reading characters and changing the color of the text in the console.
